@name Raw HTML
@description

You can use **raw HTML** in your Markdown, and it'll mostly work pretty well. It's there, but try to avoid it unless you really need it!

```markdown
<dl>
  <dt class='first-child'>Definition list</dt>
  <dd>Is something people use sometimes.</dd>

  <dt>Markdown in HTML</dt>
  <dd>Sure, but you _better_ have a **very** good reason. We suggest HTML <em>tags</em> instead.</dd>
</dl>

<p>Some HTML is **forbidden**, `<iframe>` and `<script>`,to name a couple, can't be used. They will be ~~removed~~ from the resulting HTML.</p>

<iframe src='http://irrelevant-site.com'></iframe>

<script>alert('BOOM!');</script>
