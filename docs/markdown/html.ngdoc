@name Raw HTML
@description

You can use **raw HTML** in your Markdown, and it'll mostly work pretty well. It's there, but try to avoid it unless you really need it!

```markdown
<dl>
  <dt class='first-child'>Definition list</dt>
  <dd>Is something people use sometimes.</dd>

  <dt>Markdown in HTML</dt>
  <dd>Sure, but you _better_ have a **very** good reason. We suggest HTML <em>tags</em> instead.</dd>
</dl>
