@name Tables!
@description

Tables are built using pipes <kbd>|</kbd> and hyphens <kbd>-</kbd>. They are not the prettiest feature of Markdown, but we've included them to support tabular data display. You really shouldn't be using these for layouting, though.

```no-highlight
Colons can be used to align columns.

| Tables        | Are           | Cool  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| col 3 is      | right-aligned | $1600 |
| col 2 is      | centered      |   $12 |
| zebra stripes | are neat      |    $1 |

The outer pipes are optional, and you don't need to make the raw Markdown line up prettily, but _we encourage readability_. You can also use inline Markdown.

Markdown | Less | Pretty
--- | --- | ---
*Still* | `renders` | **nicely**
