@name Line Breaks
@description

Line breaks using [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown "GitHub Flavored Markdown") are, luckily, _very straightforward_.

```
Here's a line for us to start with.

This line is separated from the one above by two newlines, so it will be a _separate paragraph_.




This line is also a separate paragraph, but... _(note how all those spaces still caused just one break)_
This line is only separated by a single newline, so it's a separate line in the _same paragraph_.

Another form of line breaking is using `<hr/>` horizontal rules.
