# Continuous Integration, Automated Deployments #

In the next post I'll get back to the meat of how I'm making progress in the actual application. This time however, I wanted to deviate a little, and talk about [Continuous Integration](https://travis-ci.org/ "Travis CI"), and **automated build processes**, the like of which you can achieve with **PaaS services** (also known as [Platform as a Service](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platform_as_a_service)), such as [AppHarbor](https://appharbor.com/ ".NET Cloud PaaS"), [Heroku](http://www.heroku.com/ "Cloud Application Platform"), and many others.
