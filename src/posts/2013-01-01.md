In my previous installment, I _prognosticated_ the discussion topic for this post series.

> In the next post series I'll delve into **MongoDB**, how to pair it with **Node**, and figuring out _how to communicate_ across all the application layers.

When it finally came to receiving the user input _Markdown_ produced on the client-side, and persisting it in the database, I realized I knew nothing about _Node.JS_. As I start writing this down, I realize I'm going to need to address some **more fundamental issues** before diving into _Node_.

I've read a few articles about _Node_ and _MongoDB_, but I hadn't really had any **practical experience** yet. I asked myself a few questions, and I feel like _I need to answer at least some of them before going forward_.

- How I would prevent or mitigate _over-posting_ issues?
- How am I going to perform **model validation**?
- How am I going to **separate concerns**?
- How am I going to **structure the application**? I probably should refer to a framework such as [Backbone.JS](http://backbonejs.org/ "Backbone.JS"), [Knockout.JS](http://knockoutjs.com/ "Knockout.JS"), or the like.
- Am I going to use the native _MongoDB_ [driver](http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Drivers)? Am I going to find [Mongoose ODM](http://mongoosejs.com/ "Mongoose Object Document Mapper") useful at all?
- Lastly, _how the **heck** am I going to render views that require a model_? Will I pair my templating engine with some other [templating](http://mustache.github.com/ "Mustache") [language](http://handlebarsjs.com/ "Handlebars")? Will my implementation do _just fine_ on its own?

> I sifted through [Learning Node](http://www.amazon.com/dp/1449323073 "Learning Node, O'Reiley, Aug 2012"), it serves as a pretty decent **introductory crash-course** for answering most of the questions I had.

The template I started off with had just a `server.js` file that contained everything server-side: http server configuration, error handling, routing, route behavior, etc. I want a more **robust separation of concerns** going forward.
