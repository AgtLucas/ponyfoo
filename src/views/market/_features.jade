            ### Quick start, ease of use

            Blogging made easy.
            Getting set up is _fast_ whether you want just a technical blog, or to _fork_ the git repository.

            Creating your own blog is easy! Just type a _vanity subdomain_ into the input box [above](#top), and then register an account with either your email or using a provider such as GitHub!

             ### Responsive, sharp design

             **NBrut** is designed using the latest <kbd>HTML5</kbd> and <kbd>CSS3</kbd> trends. Yet, the design is responsive, and it was implemented using a Mobile First approach.

             The layout will _adapt itself_ to any screen size, allowing for a more than reasonable user experience in mobile web browsers.

            ### Markdown support for bloggers and commenters alike

            Blogging is simple, it shouldn't be complicated. We, as developers, are used to writing Markdown on StackOverflow and GitHub alike.

            **NBrut** expands on that culture by providing an experience entirely based on the Markdown syntax.
