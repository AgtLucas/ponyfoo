# Asset management in Node #

Client-side asset management reveals a series of issues with **Node.JS** and **npm** today:

- Node.JS is just a few years old (it was born in _2009_)
- Some areas, such as client-side asset managers, don't have a well defined **best library**
- Publishing packages is astonishingly easy
- Large amounts of packages are available

This wouldn't be an issue if **npm** made it possible to _visualize_ which packages are most actively being developed, maintained, and widely used. When looking for an asset manager, I found out there were at least five different asset managers I just _had_ to try. But their interfaces felt clunky enough I ended up deciding to contribute to the mess with [yet another asset manager package](https://npmjs.org/package/node-assetify "node-assetify on npm").

## Features ##

I wanted an asset manager that was:

- **Easy to configure**, I didn't want to spend _hours_ figuring out what the package source was doing, or _supposed_ to be doing
- I wanted to be able to create different **profiles**, yet manage everything the exact same way
- I wanted it to support **pre-processing**, such as compiling _SASS_ or _CoffeeScript_
- **Extensible**, so that if it didn't support something out of the box, I could extend it intuitively to get the behavior I expected
- **Bundling and minification** was also a must, but I wanted to be able to control this.

And besides the above, I wanted the package to also deal with rendering the `<script>` and `<link>` tags. And I wanted it to do this in the _same order_ I passed to the asset manager configuration, since **order matters**.

## Introducing [node-assetify](https://github.com/bevacqua/node-assetify "node-assetify on GitHub") ##

I attempted to cover most of **node-assetify**'s functionality in its documentation on **GitHub**.
