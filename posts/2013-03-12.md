# Introduction to SEO and Content Indexing #

Just a few days ago, [Google](http://google.com "Google Search Engine") started indexing [this blog](http://www.ponyfoo.com/ "Pony Foo"), and its *just starting to show up* in their search results. I wanted to mention the _careful steps_ I took to make a good impression on them.

I must open mentioning I'm no expert nor authority on SEO, **I just read a lot**.

The absolute first step was *making the markup semantic*. That is, using **HTML 5** tags, such as `<article>`, `<section>`, `<header>`, `<footer>` and so on. For a _full list of HTML 5 tags_, [visit MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/HTML/HTML5/HTML5_element_list "HTML 5 Tag List").
