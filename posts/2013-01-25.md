# Unobtrusive Paging #

Traditionally, lists on websites have been paged to allow data to be _chunked_ rather than sent out all at once, when the user might not need all of it _right away_, improving both _overall performance_ and _perceived speed_, both of which are very important to **web usability**.

# Traditional Paging #

Something along these lines is what traditionally is done in order to _implement_ a paged list:

- First of all, the list is **sorted**
- The first page of the list is provided
- A **pager**, or list of pages is presented
- When the user **clicks** on a page, a new page is loaded

![The most common implementation of paging][1]


### What's wrong with this? ###

This implementation of a paged list is rather **rudimentary**. The major flaw of traditional paged lists, is the _typically_ **incorrect assumption** that the user really cares about _a particular page_, or which particular page they are _looking at_.

Have you ever wanted to go to a **particular** page in a list on a website?  
How about, for a reason _other than **"because I figure the result should be more or less around... here"**_?

> Page numbers are, in the _vast majority_ of cases, an **implementation detail**. And they should be treated as such.

-clicks
-AJAX loads

how could it be improved?
-no pager
-RT updates
