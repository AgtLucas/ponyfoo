# JavaScript Pearls #

_JavaScript_ is one of the most **loved and hated** languages out there. Some, can't stand the stench of how obtuse it _appears_ to be. Some appreciate the "anything goes" virtues of an interpreted language, and would marry _JavaScript_ given the chance.

Lets enumerate common **controversial statements**, or the _hate speech_.

- Awkward **equality comparers**, `==`, `===` are infuriating
- The callee of a function can change the **meaning of `this`**
- **Anything goes**. Loose typing, dynamic interpreted language and how pretty much everything can mutate into anything without notice
- Nonsensical behavior like `parseInt('08') === 0` [(this one changed recently for V8)](http://code.google.com/p/v8/issues/detail?id=1645 "V8 Issues - parseInt still parsing octal")
- **Callback hell**, or how _easily_ you can lose track of what's going on
- Poor support for (classical) **debugging**, such as _reasonable_ stack traces
- **Prototypal** vs _Classical_ inheritance
- [All things JavaScript suck](http://java.dzone.com/articles/f-mongodb-f-nodejs-and-f-you "F MongoDB, F Node.js, and F You!")

> I mostly **disagree** with the above, and I want to spend _a few words_ addressing these concerns. Lets examine each one in more detail.
