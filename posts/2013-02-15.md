# JavaScript Pearls #

_JavaScript_ is one of the most **loved and hated** languages out there. Some, can't stand the stench of how obtuse it _appears_ to be. Some appreciate the "anything goes" virtues of an interpreted language, and would marry _JavaScript_ given the chance.

Behold: the **"hate speech"**.

- Interpreted languages are too bug-prone
- Awkward **equality comparers**, `==`, `===` are infuriating
- The callee of a function can change the **meaning of `this`**
- **Anything goes**. Loose typing, how pretty much everything can mutate into anything without notice
- Nonsensical behavior like `parseInt('08') === 0` [(this one changed recently for V8)](http://code.google.com/p/v8/issues/detail?id=1645 "V8 Issues - parseInt still parsing octal")
- **Callback hell**, or how _easily_ you can lose track of what's going on
- Poor support for (classical) **debugging**, such as _reasonable_ stack traces
- **Prototypal** vs _Classical_ inheritance
- [All things JavaScript suck](http://java.dzone.com/articles/f-mongodb-f-nodejs-and-f-you "F MongoDB, F Node.js, and F You!")

> I **disagree** with most of the above, and I want to spend _a few words_ addressing these concerns.

First of all, the _vast majority_ of these concerns arise from the paradigm shift people experience when developing in _JavaScript_. Most people are accustomed to a compiler telling them when something is amiss. In _JavaScript_, however, there is no compiler, _JavaScript_ is interpreted as it is executed. There are a few ways to work around (or _mitigate_) this concern.

One way to _mitigate_ the impact of not being able to compile your code, is [`use strict`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Reference/Functions_and_function_scope/Strict_mode "Strict mode explained"). By the way, [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript "Mozilla Developer Network") is an **extensive resource library** on _JavaScript_ you are _not using enough_.

`use strict` in _JavaScript_ is reminiscent of [Option Explicit](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/y9341s4f(v=vs.80).aspx "MSDN - Option Explicit"), back in the _Visual Basic 6_ days. It's merely a safeguard against silly mistakes, but it comes in handy.

A more **definitive** approach to solve the issue is to resort to a _JavaScript_ compiler, such as [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/ "CoffeeScript Language"), or [TypeScript](http://www.typescriptlang.org/ "TypeScript Language").

> I discourage taking this approach. Not only because languages like _CoffeeScript_ tend to be **very opinionated** about how your code should look like, but most importantly, it isn't _JavaScript_, it's an _entirely different_ language; even though it **incidentally** compiles to _JavaScript_.

> The notion of using _TypeScript_ is slightly less infuriating, since it's a _superset_ of _JavaScript_, rather than a different language.

Having said that, **the fact that both compilers output pure _JavaScript_ remains**, which is reason enough to learn how to code in _JavaScript_ properly by yourself, rather than have a layer of abstraction making coding style choices for you. It's not like _JavaScript_ is [MSIL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Intermediate_Language "Microsoft Intermediate Language"). _MSIL_ is **really hard** to read, maintain, write, and everything in between, and generally _not worthwhile to code in_, unless you need to _fine-tune performance_, dynamically _generate classes_, or the like.

A ["simple" program](http://www.dotnetperls.com/il "Example Source") in _MSIL_ might be:

	.method private hidebysig static void Main() cil managed
	{
		.entrypoint
		.maxstack 2
		.locals init (
		[0] int32 num)
		L_0000: ldc.i4.0
		L_0001: stloc.0
		L_0002: br.s L_000e
		L_0004: ldloc.0
		L_0005: call void [mscorlib]System.Console::WriteLine(int32)
		L_000a: ldloc.0
		L_000b: ldc.i4.1
		L_000c: add
		L_000d: stloc.0
		L_000e: ldloc.0
		L_000f: ldc.i4.s 10
		L_0011: blt.s L_0004
		L_0013: ret
	}

 _JavaScript_ is not _that_ **obscure**. _JavaScript_ can be learnt. Compilers _hinder_ your ability to do that. You should learn what a _closure_ is. How to extend a _prototype_. How to use _callbacks_ sensibly. There lies the real beauty of _JavaScript_ code.

> - Interpreted languages are too bug-prone

While it might be true that _JavaScript_ code is harder to debug, and can definitely be _harder to maintain when improperly structured_. There are several tools at our disposal to prevent chaos.

You should treat _JavaScript_ as you would any other language, and as such, you should **Unit Test** your code. There are [several](http://pivotal.github.com/jasmine/ "Jasmine BDD Test Framework") [frameworks](http://visionmedia.github.com/mocha/ "Mocha Test Framework") [to](http://vowsjs.org/ "Bows BDD Test Framework") [pick](http://qunitjs.com/ "QUnit by jQuery") [from](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/yuitest/ "YUI Test from Yahoo"), I won't go into detail in this post, though.
