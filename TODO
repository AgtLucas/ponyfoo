LAUNCH

- flash intro page

PERFORMANCE

- critical path css inline (https://github.com/pocketjoso/penthouse)

NICETIES

- metadata
  - account/login
- prettify comment ui
- improve on desktop breakpoints: sidebar
- (author) bio editor!
- bio show up as aside box.
- (author) email composer with subject, intro, and markdown body
- flash should be in layout really?
- keyboard shortcuts!

OBSCURE BUGS

- json when navigating back is SUPER AWKWARD!
- views that respond with json e.g 404, should prob use a taunus method?
