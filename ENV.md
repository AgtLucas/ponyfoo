Environment Variables
=====================

Environment configuration is taken from `.env.defaults`, then `.env`, and lastly, `process.env`.

If you are hosting your site using [**Heroku**](https://heroku.com "Heroku"), you might want to use [**Foreman**](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/config-vars#local-setup "Local Setup for Heroku sites") to configure these locally.

A good alternative is the JetBrains IDE for Node.JS, [**WebStorm**](http://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/ "WebStorm"). 

Note that most of these have default values, which might come either from Node.js or from the configuration file for **Pony Foo**.

Required
--------

These are the environment variables that are an _absolute must_ for **Pony Foo** to run.

- No environment variables are required to installing **Pony Foo**.



General
-------

These are general purpose variables which are always useful to configure.

- **LOG_LEVEL**: One of the following values: `['DEBUG','INFO','WARN','ERROR','FATAL']`. Determines the verbosity of the logging output.
- **PLATFORM_NAME**: The name of the platform, used throught the application to refer to the entire platform.



Hosting
-------

These variables are usually very important for **deployments**, but the default values are _Ok_ in the development environment.

- **NODE_ENV**: Node.js environment, defaults to `'development'`, options include `'staging'` and `'production'`. By default, production environments minify and bundle assets, compress responses, while the development environment uses unminified sources and provides a few more features for debugging.
- **HOST_TLD**: The `TLD` for the site, this is important when slugging, because every blog is hosted on a subdomain. Defaults to `'local-ponyfoo.com'`.
- **ENABLE_SLUGGING**: Enables blog slugging. When disabled, users can't create their own blogs on the platform. Defaults to `false`.

- **ENABLE_MARKET**: Whether the market vhost is enabled. Defaults to `false`.
- **HOST_MARKET**: The default `slug` for the site, that is, the **semantic root** of the site. Defaults to `'www'`.

- **HOST_DOCS**: The subdomain used to host the platform documentation.

- **HOST_REGEX**: An optional regex to restrict the host. Useful when your site is accessible through multiple `TLD`s but you only want one to serve responses. When a request doesn't match this regex, it gets permanently redirected to the same url on the default TLD.
- **PORT**: The actual port where the application will listen on. Defaults to port `8081`.
- **PUBLIC_PORT**: The public facing port. Sometimes, production environments use architectures set up with load balancers and assign ports arbitrarily to your application, but the domain will still use port `80`, this helps avoid issues when redirecting requests. Defaults to `PORT`.

- **MONGO_URI** (or **MONGOLAB_URI**): The connection uri to your MongoDB server. Defaults to `'mongodb://localhost/ponyfoo'`.

- **BLOG_DEFAULT**: The default blog slug. Defaults to `'blog'`. i.e: http://blog.local-ponyfoo.com`
- **BLOG_REGEX**: An optional regex to restrict the subdomains that are available to users. Implicitly adds `'^'` and `'$'` to the regex. Requests that fail a test against this regex get permanently redirected to the default slug. By default it's unrestricted.
- **ENABLE_BLOG_REGEX_301**: If `'true'`, permanently redirects requests to filtered blog slugs to the market home.
