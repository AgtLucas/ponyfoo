NBrut [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/bevacqua/NBrut.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/bevacqua/NBrut)
========================================================================================================================

**NBrut** is the open-source blog engine underlying technology in [**Pony Foo**](http://ponyfoo.com "Pony Foo"), my technical blog site.

**NBrut** is built entirely upon _Node.JS_, _MongoDB_, and a rich client-side application layer.

You can read all about how I work on **NBrut** directly on my blog, also feel free to fork this repository and fiddle with it. I'd also be delighted to hear from you, so feel free to contact me, as well.
