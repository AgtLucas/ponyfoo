NBrut [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/bevacqua/NBrut.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/bevacqua/NBrut)
========================================================================================================================

**NBrut** is the open-source blog engine underlying technology in [**Pony Foo**](http://ponyfoo.com "Pony Foo"), my technical blog site.

**NBrut** is built entirely upon _Node.JS_, _MongoDB_, and a rich client-side application layer, so it's **Javascript everywhere**.

You can read all about how I work on **NBrut** directly on my [blog](http://www.ponyfoo.com/2012/12/25/pony-foo-begins "Introductory Post"), also feel free to fork this repository and fiddle with it. I'd also be delighted to hear from you, so feel free to contact me, as well.
