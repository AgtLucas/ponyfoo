LAUNCH

- flash intro page

TODO

- not ALL the fields
- not ALL the sub-documents!!!
- deployment script

PERFORMANCE

- revving
- canonical, etc: fill metadata (see defaultRequestModel.js)
- critical path css inline
- further unbloat all.js
  - load FAT js after page completes loading

NICETIES

- (author) email composer with subject, intro, and markdown body
- (author) bio editor!
- bio show up as aside box.
- flash should be in layout really?
- cmd + enter look up a lib that has simple api


OBSCURE BUGS

- json when navigating back is SUPER AWKWARD!
- views that respond with json e.g 404, should prob use a taunus method?
